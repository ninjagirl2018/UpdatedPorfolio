              <p>There is nothing I enjoy more than showing my clients the true value of a well thought out business process.  Whether we are talking about the design of a business process, the automation of a manual operation into software, or using an organization's valuable data and translating that into meaningful business intelligence, I believe that technology in the world of business must serve it's users.</p>
              <p>Technology, specifically software development, should not intimidate.  I have spent the last decade - an eon in the technology age - making technology accessible, and more importantly, useful, to all my clients.
              <br>
              <p>In your organization, if you are constantly thinking "There must be a better way to do this", but you don't know where to start, <i>we should talk.</i>  If you are pondering why you have all sorts of data but it's not as useful as it ought to be, <i>we should talk</i>.  If you're thinking about Business Intelligence and thinking about how to leverage that to make more informed decisions, <i>we should talk</i>.  If you have any thoughts about why your Line of Business Applications are not as effective as they could be, <i>we should talk.</i></p>
              <p>I spend my days doing what I love most, which is learning about your business.  I commute between boardrooms and developer huddles, and advocate business reuqirements tirelessly to development teams to ensure that technology and Line of Business applications SERVE whatever goals my clients may have for their business.  I would love to learn about your business and work with you towards making your technology serve you!  If this sounds like a conversation that you've been having with yourself for awhile now, reach out.  I would love to hear from you.</p>
